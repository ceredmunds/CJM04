abstract = {The vast majority of studies into visual processing are conducted
using computer display technology. The current paper describes a new free suite
of software tools designed to make this task easier, using the latest advances
in hardware and software. PsychoPy is a platform-independent experimental
control system written in the Python interpreted language using entirely free
libraries. PsychoPy scripts are designed to be extremely easy to read and
write, while retaining complete power for the user to customize the stimuli and
environment. Tools are provided within the package to allow everything from
stimulus presentation and response collection (from a wide range of devices) to
simple data analysis such as psychometric function fitting. Most importantly,
PsychoPy is highly extensible and the whole system can evolve via user
contributions. If a user wants to add support for a particular stimulus,
analysis or hardware device they can look at the code for existing examples,
modify them and submit the modifications back into the package so that the
whole community benefits.},

@article{Peirce2009,
abstract = {PsychoPy is a software library written in Python, using OpenGL to
generate very precise visual stimuli on standard personal computers. It is
designed to allow the construction of as wide a variety of neuroscience
experiments as possible, with the least effort. By writing scripts in standard
Python syntax users can generate an enormous variety of visual and auditory
stimuli and can interact with a wide range of external hardware (enabling its
use in fMRI, EEG, MEG etc.). The structure of scripts is simple and intuitive.
As a result, new experiments can be written very quickly, and trying to
understand a previously written script is easy, even with minimal code
comments. PsychoPy can also generate movies and image sequences to be used in
demos or simulated neuroscience experiments. This paper describes the range of
tools and stimuli that it provides and the environment in which experiments are
conducted.},
